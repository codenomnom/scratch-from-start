<p>
  Too obvious, but neglected <i>way too often!</i> The file is the entry point of your repository and the first thing people see.
  It should contain a brief explanation of what the code does, as well as instructions how to use it.
</p>

<p>
  The main goal is to ease others (or even yourself) using your code. It's not uncommon to return to a project after a long time,
  and be unsure of how it worked before. The file should contain as much concise information as possible:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is this project for</li>
  <li>
    Instructions how to run it on your machine {% chip "important" %}
    <ul>
      <li>System requirements</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Links to other documents {% chip "important" %}
    <ul>
      <li>Contributing, Code of Conduct</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Basic list of technologies used</li>
  <li>Roles and responsibilities</li>
  <li>Points of contact</li>
</ul>

<p><i>TODO: sample</i></p>
