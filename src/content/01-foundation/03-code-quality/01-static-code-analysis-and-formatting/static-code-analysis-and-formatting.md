<p>
  By definition, static analysis <i>"identifies and fixes defects before you run a program"</i>.
  But it's even more than that. It helps your code stay cohesive regardless of the developers count,
  their seniority or experience. It makes work easier and safer.
</p>

<p>
  One of the first things to setup is a linter/formatter. You can use
  <a
      href="https://eslint.org/"
      target="_blank" class="underlined colorful"
  >
    ESLint
  </a> for JavaScript,
  <a
      href="https://palantir.github.io/tslint/"
      target="_blank" class="underlined colorful"
  >
    TSLint
  </a> for TypeScript or even go further with
  <a
      href="https://palantir.github.io/tslint/"
      target="_blank" class="underlined colorful"
  >
    Prettier
  </a>.

  Regardless of your choice, your main task is to setup the foundation for a clean code.

<p>
  So <code style="font-weight: bold;">make sure it lints! {% chip "important" %}</code>
  - you'll add rules with time.
